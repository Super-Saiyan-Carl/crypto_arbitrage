Repository for my 3rd weekly challenge

Part 1: Collected data to show the open/high/low/close/btc_volume/usd_volume/weighted_price of bitcoin on both the bitcoin and bitstamp exchanges from jan 1 2018 to march 31 2018. Changed close column data type to float and dropped duplicate values for each.

Part 2: Generated statistics and plotted the data for 3 different days in the data set from each exchange (Jan 2, Feb 14, Mar 31). Based on only the vizualizations of the different time periods, the spread does appear to tighten up as time progresses.  The largest spread seem to be at the end of January 2018.

Part 3: Analyzed bitcoin spreads between the two exchanges for those three specific dates.

Part 4: Calculated the arbitrage profits.  Based on only the vizualizations of the different time periods, the spread does appear to tighten up as time progresses.  The largest spread seem to be at the end of January 2018.
